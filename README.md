# Mapping Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes with JavaScript, Mapbox, APIs and Leaflet

#### Overview:

A map to display a layer with the last seven days earthquakes, having a circle as marker located over the center of the earthquake with a radius proportional to its magnitude, as well as its color. A legend shows the range of each earthquake color-magnitude relation.
Additionally, a second layer with the tectonic plates can be activated and deactivated.
Both layers overlap three possibilities of background map: street, satellite street and light.
